# Backtracking-algorithm
Backtracking algorithm

````
 A Backtracking algorithm in order to solve a Takuzu or else Binary puzzle. It also contains a very primitive implementation of a brute force kind of recursive algorithm for the solution of totally empty grids with a limitation of up to 6x6 by grids. The constraints and the validations are implemented differently for empty grids, incomplete grids, and complete grids and some of the methods that involve row and column filtering are universal by using a function to shift rows to columns.
